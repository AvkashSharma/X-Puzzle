class Move:

# puzzle dimension must be scalable

# state = seqence of number (ex: 3, 0, 1, 4, 2, 6, 5, 7)

# look posibilities(pass the state)
# use numpy matrix to represnt state

#   find zero
#       isCorner?
#           [rXc] = [2x4]
#           [0,0] is corner
#           [r-1, 0] is corner [1, 0]
#           [0, c-1] is corner [0,3]
#           [r-1,c-1] is corner [1, 3]
#       rest is all normal moves 
#       
#       yes: all wrap
#       Check position and get posibile moves
